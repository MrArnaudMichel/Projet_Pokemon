## Description

This is a Pokemon fan game made in python using pygame. The game is a 2D top-down game where you can move around the map, interact with objects and NPCs, and battle wild Pokémon. It is still in development and is not yet complete. The game is inspired by the Pokémon Essentials project and aims to recreate the experience of playing a Pokémon game on the PC. It is open-source and anyone can contribute to the project.
